# Code for paper: Contrasting Deep Learning Models for Direct Respiratory Insufficiency Detection Versus Blood Oxygen Saturation Estimation
This repository will host the codes used in the paper "Contrasting Deep Learning Models for Direct Respiratory Insufficiency Detection Versus Blood Oxygen Saturation Estimation". Any questions can be directed to marcelomatheusgauy@gmail.com.

The paper uses 4 models: CNN6, CNN10, CNN14 from https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn and Audio-MAE from https://github.com/facebookresearch/AudioMAE. The pretrained models can be found on the original repositories. We just finetune their pretrained models on the SPIRA datasets (one of them can be found here: https://github.com/Edresson/SPIRA-ACL2021 and some here: https://zenodo.org/records/6672451) and make minor adaptations to the codebase so it can operate our files. Credit on the models goes to the original creators (we are including parts of their code here for completion and simplicity of the user to run our codes). Due to the sensitive nature of the data, the published datasets may differ slightly from the complete ones used in our models. Each folder should contain enough to run the models provided the paths to audio files and pretrained models are corrected. Further information is given in the respective folders
